# HTML and CSS landing page

This project is a landing page for a fictional brand called "Capulus".

The design of the project was inspirated by [this](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1077158798872606718/coffee-website-ui-ux) figma project, but I made some changes and tried to learn how to use figma in the process.

The project contains:

- Navbar
- Hero section
- Products section
- Brands section
- Footer

In the future I will add Javascript and other pages.
